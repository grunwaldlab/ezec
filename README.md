# ezec: Easy Interface to Effective Concentration Calculations

Because fungicide resistance is an important phenotypic trait for fungi and
oomycetes, it is necessary to have a standardized method of statistically
analyzing the Effective Concentration (EC) values. This package is designed for
those who are not terribly familiar with R to be able to analyze and plot an
entire set of isolates using the drc package.

## Installation

You can install this package from GitHub using devtools:

```r
devtools::install_github("grunwaldlab/ezec")
```
