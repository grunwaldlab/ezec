Description: Because fungicide resistance is an important phenotypic trait
    for fungi and oomycetes, it is necessary to have a standardized method of statistically
    analyzing the Effective Concentration (EC) values. This package is designed for
    those who are not terribly familiar with R to be able to analyze and plot an
    entire set of isolates using the drc package.
Depends:
    R (>= 3.2.0)
Imports:
    drc,
    dplyr
License: GPL-3
LazyData: true
Suggests:
    testthat,
    readxl
